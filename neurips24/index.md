# About

Advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques based on deep representations, such as GPT and Stable Diffusion, have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in analyzing vast amounts of data and generating coherent responses from unstructured data. They achieve this through sophisticated architectures that capture subtle relationships and dependencies. However, these models predominantly identify dependencies rather than establishing and making use of causal relationships. This can lead to potential spurious correlations and algorithmic bias, limiting the models’ interpretability and trustworthiness.
In contrast, traditional causal discovery methods aim to identify causal relationships within observed data in an unsupervised manner. While these methods show promising results in scenarios with fully observed data, they struggle to handle complex real-world situations where causal effects occur in latent spaces when handling images, videos, and possibly text.

Recently, causal representation learning (CRL) has made significant progress in addressing the aforementioned challenges, demonstrating great potential in understanding the causal relationships underlying observed data. These techniques are expected to enable researchers to identify latent causal variables and discern the relationships among them,  which provides an efficient way to disentangle representations and enhance the reliability and interpretability of models.
The goal of this workshop is to explore the challenges and opportunities in this field, discuss recent progress, and identify open questions, and provide a platform to inpire cross-disciplinary collaborations. This workshop will cover both theoretical and applied aspects of CRL, including, but not limited to, the following topics:

- **Theory of causal representation learning**

- **Causal representation learning models**

- **Causal discovery with latent variables**

- **Causal generative models**

- **Applications of causal representation learning, such as in biology, economics, and image/video analysis**

- **Benchmarking causal representation learning**

<!-- # Open Catalyst Challenge -->

<!-- The Open Catalyst Challenge 2023 invites participants to help address the pressing challenges faced by the world due to energy scarcity and climate change. In this area, a critical problem is the discovery of new catalysts for driving efficient and carbon-neutral means for energy storage and conversion.

Over the past two years, the Open Catalyst Challenge has focused on the central task of relaxed (local minimum) energy prediction. This year’s task of determining the adsorption energy (global minimum) will require relaxed energy prediction as a subtask. -->
